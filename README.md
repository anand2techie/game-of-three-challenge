# Overview

This a game played through WebSockets. Game of Three, when a player starts, he is added to a queue to wait for a rival, once a rival player is available, either of them can incept a random (whole) number and sends it to the second a player as an approach of starting the game.
The receiving player can now always choose between adding one of  {­1, 0, 1} to get to a number that is divisible by 3. Divide it by 3. The resulting whole number is then sent back to the original sender.

# Design

- This app built Spring Boot, Java 8, WebSockets.
- It demonstrates Java concurrency, thread safe, sessions and locking.
- As a backend developer, HTML, JS, and CSS is very basic and reused from another project with some minor modifications.
- This app is stateful, it uses the browser session id after page load.
- Sessions are added to a queue so they can wait for other sessions.
- Game states are also stored to maintained locking, waiting, and game state.
- When the game ends, sessions are simply cleared.
- What is missing or good to have feature, is a scheduler to check expired sessions in the queue and check also for disconnection events.

### Testing
Application can be built with:
```sh
$ mvn clean install
```
Run the JAR with:
